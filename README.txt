The sample project provided in the item 2 also appears inside the sample workspace in that item so it's way easier to set it up. Anyways please check the steps in the "Configure HTPPS" for the certificate.

Please note that: Both the Acme-Madruga project and the war file provided in the items 4 and 5, respectively, have HTTPS implemented so in order to be able to test them you need to configure your workspace/system following the steps in the "Configure HTTPS" document in the item 2.
